- should a dfa be parametrized by its alphabet?
- need a way to "type check" the dfa
- could define a type struct TransitionFunction (i32, char, i32)?
- return Result<Self, Error> instead of asserting in dfa constructor
- add a fn to dfa impl to incrementally create tfn
- use a list slice or something instead of recreating State objects for final state? or annotate state with is_final?
- switch to thiserror for less boilerplate in error class definitions?
- stop using tfn.clone() in tests? is there a better way to do it?
- do we need to impl clone and copy for state? what are the implications of doing so?
- put some canonical dfas in a reusable place so i can use in tests?
- move common definitions like state into their own file
- call it invalidacceptstates?
- in new, make accept, alphabet etc just plain lists (dedupe and conversion to hashset can happen internally with warnings if req)
- test nfa with epsilons in tfn
